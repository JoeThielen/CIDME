## What is CIDME???
CIDME is software to help manage contextualized contact/identity information and is meant to be integrated/embedded/used by other software projects/applications.  At it's most basic level, it could be considered a contact manager... _on steroids_!  But it's much more than that.  There is a lot of software out there that can manage contact/identity information.  CIDME is different in that it brings another concept into play... putting this information into _contexts_.

## What are contexts?
In the health care world a context could be an _episode of care_ or even an individual _encounter_ for a given patient.  In _case management_, the individual _cases_ themselves could be contexts.  Complexes cases may actually need to be dealt with in parts, each of which could also be considered a context.  

To put it another way, let's consider the fictional character of [Dr. Jekyll / Mr. Hyde](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Jekyll_and_Mr._Hyde_(character)).  Technically, this is one person.  One _entity_.  But you could consider him to have two separate _identities_... one as _Dr. Jeckyll_ and the other as _Mr. Hyde_.

## What does CIDME _not_ do?
CIDME does not provide for access control / authorization (_but it certainly could be incorporated into one_).  There are already many software projects/solutions that deal with this.  Therefore, CIDME doesn't necessarily fall into these following categories:
* **Identity Management (__IdM__)**
* **Identity and Access Management (_IaM_)**
* **Access and identity management" (_AIM_)**

CIDME is not, nor does it use, _LDAP_.  However CIDME does provide a lot of similar functionality as LDAP / _directory services_.

## Who is "*we*"?

Well, um, currently, it's just me, Joe Thielen, project creator.  But I'm hoping in time the project will grow and be joined by other individuals who share similar beliefs in the project goals / guidelines.

Please, *feel free* to drop me a line!  I've created this project on GitHub specifically to help attract attention and make the project larger than myself.

## Who is *Joe Thielen*?

I've been creating fairly complex, but monolithic, LAMP apps for both non- and for-profit companies for over 20 years.  My experience lies with small- and medium- sized organizations / businesses in the USA.  Most of these apps have, in one form or another, made heavy use of, or even dealt primarily with, contact / identity information.  The genesis of this project was to create a separate piece of software to provide this functionality, so as to be able to be used by other software projects.
